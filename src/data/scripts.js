  subject: "Constituent Input on the SAVE Act",
  body: `Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing as your constituent from [City, State] regarding the SAVE Act (Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act), which would require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote.

I want to share my perspective on this legislation:

1. Voter access matters. An estimated 150 million or more Americans do not have a valid passport, and an estimated 21 million citizens lack easy access to any citizenship document. These are our neighbors, seniors, and veterans.

2. The evidence shows the current system works. A Brennan Center survey of 42 local election jurisdictions found that suspected noncitizen voting occurred at a rate of approximately 0.0001% in the 2016 election. Existing penalties — including deportation and criminal prosecution — are already strong deterrents.

3. Real-world consequences are significant. When Kansas implemented a similar requirement from 2013 to 2018, more than 31,000 eligible citizens were prevented from registering to vote before the law was struck down in court.

4. Document costs create a burden. A passport costs $130–$165, and replacement naturalization certificates cost $555. For many families, these fees amount to an unfunded mandate to exercise a constitutional right.

I respectfully ask that you consider these impacts as you evaluate this legislation. I would appreciate a response sharing your position.

Sincerely,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Address]
[City, State ZIP]`,
